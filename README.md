[00:20.99] Get rid of debris from the rusty time, those years (those years)
[00:27.82] Don't stay in a daze looking for a sign, start in a trice
[00:56.32] 
[00:34.16] Run across fields of ice
[00:35.97] Bathing in the starlight
[00:37.96] Be well aware of roads we've gone by
[00:40.86] Put yesterday's aside
[00:42.70] Meet the future head-on
[00:44.17] Now, trailblazers keep credos in mind
[00:49.33] (I won't say it twice!)
[01:00.83] 
[00:51.20] One, stop staying within the lines
[00:54.67] Two, we always align
[00:58.15] Three, even if we don't gain the upper hand, we'll fight for right
[01:04.92] Four, never care a rap for hindsight
[01:08.30] Five, let us light the night
[01:11.55] Six, even when there are wheels within wheels, go ahead
[01:18.41] Get it pulverized
